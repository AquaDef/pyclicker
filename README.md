# pyclicker
A python-based autoclicker which uses human-random clicks with multi-layers of computer-generated randomness, I may make an updated version as a minecraft fabric mod later, would really love if you suggest me a way to make it work better in fullscreen games.

I in no way endorce the use of autoclickers as this project was to bring awareness to anti-cheat developers and server administrators of what could possibly be done to bypass anti-cheat. Please do not use this unless on a multiplayer server unless allowed.
